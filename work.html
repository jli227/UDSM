   				<h2>Outreach Project</h2>
   				<p>This project will provide students from multiple disciplines an excellent opportunity to engage with the underserved adult homeless population of the University District, a neighborhood in which the University of Washington also resides. Students will have the opportunity to link patients to available resources in the area such as existing community clinics. Students will also learn of other non-medical community resources in the area and learn referral and eligibility processes for available resources. Students will counsel patients on how to communicate with their primary care providers effectively on their current and ongoing health needs. Some specific skills that students will be able to utilize will be motivational interviewing, resources education and referral, vital sign acquisition and history taking. Volunteer sessions will occur once monthly in either a community venue setting or street outreach setting.</p>

	   			<h2>Outreach Clinics</h2>
	   			<p>UDSM currently operates outreach clinics in the U-District to assess the needs of adults experiencing
				homelessness and refer them to basic service agencies and medical providers. This outreach is provided
				through face-to- face encounters between volunteer UW Health Sciences graduate/professional students and
				homeless clients who seem interested or request such a consultation. During the encounter, which is usually
				one-on- one, the volunteer offers some free basic supplies, such as a pair of socks or a granola bar, and
				employs motivational interviewing techniques to encourage the client to explore his/her/their challenges and
				potential actions, always remaining respectful of the client’s decision-making autonomy. Occasionally, upon
				the client’s request, a non-invasive, narrowly focused, physical assessment is performed such as taking a blood
				pressure measurement or examining a wound. The volunteer concludes the encounter by providing referrals,
				resources, or information on hand as requested by the client. A licensed health professional is present at every
				outreach event as a preceptor per regulations. Outreach clinics take place in three locales. One is at Elizabeth
				Gregory Day Home (for adult women) in University Lutheran Church. Another is at the Saint Vincent de Paul
				Sunday Dinner in Blessed Sacrament Church. The third, called Street Outreach, is along the streets of the U-
				District where homeless individuals and groups are frequently seen. The outreach clinics at the two churches
				occur monthly while Street Outreach occurs every two weeks.</p>
